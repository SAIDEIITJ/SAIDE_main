    We study the impact of smartphone use on the brain, focusing on the
    relationship between smartphone use and gambling. Does smartphone addiction
    have any similarity with gambling addiction? Secondly we also explore the
    possibility of using smartphones to study cognition in a more naturalistic
    way compared to traditional lab experiments.

    We will develop a network model of the healthy and diseased human brain.
    This model will be used to simulate brain stimulation paradigms for early
    detection of neurodegenerative disorders. As internal connectivity of the
    brain changes, its response (in terms of EEG) to external stimuli (such as
    TMS) also changes. Can we detect changes in internal connectivity based on
    the observed changes in EEG? What is the best way to do that? We will answer
    these questions in this project.

    Research Initiation Grant to setup a TMS-EEG modality to investigate
    inhibitory control of actions in humans. Inhibitory control is a cognitive
    function that helps us override unwanted actions, thoughts and emotions.
    TMS-EEG will provide a new window into the brain processes involved in such
    a form of control through simultaneous stimulation and brain activity
    measurements.
